Example Python code for HP VAN SDN Controller 2.4.5 REST API.
Tested with Mininet 2.2.0 running OpenFlow13 OVS mode, HP 2920 with 15.16.0004 and HP 5500 EI R2221P06

Code is based on standard Requests library (pip install requests) and does not use any HP VAN specific libraries for maximum transparency.

If script requires arguments run it with --help to find out.
